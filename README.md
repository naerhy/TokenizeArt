# TokenizeArt

Creation of a token on an EVM-compatible blockchain.

## Description

TokenizeArt is the second project of 42 related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain. But this time, instead of creating a fungible token, we have to create a NFT.

I am using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) in order to deploy on and interact with an EVM compatible blockchain. It is development environment for Ethereum software which helps you write, test, debug and deploy your Solidity smart contracts using JavaScript or TypeScript.
